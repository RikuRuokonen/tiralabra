# Tiralabra - Comparision of Pathfinding Algorithms


### Description of the Application.
I do a comparision of 2 different pathfinding algorithms, JPS and A* algorithm.
I implement a terminal application that draws a maze, and then compares 2 algorithms and their execution speeds. Everything is documented and implemented in english.

### Techs
I implement this solely with Java.
